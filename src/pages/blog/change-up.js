          If At First You Don&apos;t Succeed

        <Paragraph>
          If I&apos;m being completely honest, last year&apos;s code was
          absolutely garbage. I made zero use of concurrency using the PROS
          implementation of RTOS, I had zero abstraction and encapsulation, and
          the autonomous code was an utter mess. Actually,
          <em>
            {" "}
            I don&apos;t even think the autonomous routine was anything past a
            one point autonomous routine too, so...

        <Paragraph>
          You should always seed to improve your code, even if it already works.
          That isn&apos;t to say that entire codebases should be refactored with
          &quot;more efficient&quot; algorithms and comments be sprinkled onto
          every getter and setter function, but if you have code that{" "}
          <b>you know</b> is bad but is still being used, that should be fixed
          eventually.
        </Paragraph>
        <br />
        <Paragraph>
          Thus why this year, I made use of the things I&apos;ve neglected last
          year to do it justice. I didn&apos;t spam the hell out of them, but I
          did enough to make myself feel proud of it. I think the most important
          change I made was using a good PID algorithm since last year&apos;s
          code was pretty much a &quot;clasp your hands together and pray to
          Lord in Heaven that the code will work&quot; situation so it&apos;s
          nice that I wrote code that was a massive improvement from the naive
          solutions I used last year.

        <Heading variant="section-title">Easy Game, Easy Gains</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
          Seriously, I&apos;m honestly surprised at how easy the game was this
          year compared to the massive dumpster fire that was last year&apos;s
          game. This game was a lot more predictable and made writing autonomous
          routines pretty easy. The only hiccup though is something that I have
          a bone to pick with, but that comes later.

        <Paragraph>
          All of our robot designs from the beginning to the end had beautiful
          build quality&mdash;it&apos;s probably because we found out about the
          brilliant world of <em>computer-aided design.</em> We did not make
          full use of CAD last year and that really messed us up, especially
          since we would end up making last minute changes as we were building
          the robot. This year, we there wasn&apos;t much faffing about when we
          got to building the robot, and look how that turned out.

        <Paragraph>
          About ninety-five percent of the time, when the code doesn&apos;t
          work, it&apos;s usually your fault; it could be a simple error like a
          missing semicolon, or something egregious like a segmentation fault.
          However, the other five percent of the time, someone completely out of
          your control breaks your code. Of that five percent, ninety percent of
          it is due to dependencies and the the ones that make and maintain it.
          Believe it or not, in a systems programming situation like this,
          <em>hardware is the biggest dependency in a project.</em>

          You would think that after three years since the initial release of
          the VEX V5 system, the REC Foundation would have been able to iron out
          all of the issues with the system. <em>Apparently not,</em> because
          the hardware suffers from the
          <em>same issues from 2018.</em> Here are some pretty mind-boggling
          problems that still persist in their released hardware:

            The tolerances in manufacturing the rotation sensors are way too

            The VEX Vision Sensor is basically useless in even moderate lighting

          As much as I love my organization, I have a bone to pick with them.{" "}
          <em> we use like, zero sensors.</em> A robot with good code and no
          sensors is like if you shoved a Bugatti Veyron engine into the body of
          a Honda Civic. The hardware matters as much as the software does in
          systems programming and when you are given zero external input about
          your surroundings, you might as well be coding blind.

          With a new game comes a time to correct the wrongs that have happened

          but I can at least improve my skill set, coding knowledge-wise and 
          problem solving-wise. This new game, &quot;Tipping Point&quot;, seems
          like it&apos;s going to help me with just that&mdash;it looks pretty
